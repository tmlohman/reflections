When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
This would be useful when I want to share work (eg. for networking or job application purposes), or when I want to make a 
project collaborative.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might not want to make a commit public right away. Or, you might not want to have a collaborator's changes affect your 
local repository right away.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are different branches of a repository on Github, owned by different users. While a fork refers back to the repository 
it came from, changes to the fork will not change the original repository.
Clones are copies of repositories. You can either clone a repository on Github, or locally.
A branch is a single strand of any repository.
